### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Wandile**](https://www.miraya.tech), a Fround-end developer based in South Africa.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are figma, apple notes.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [Anime-Blog](https://owamit9.github.io/Anime-Blog/).

#### Fun Facts:

* Hate coffee but love tea...i know it's weird
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
* **Hobbies:** anime, gym, coding
