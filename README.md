### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Wandile**](https://www.miraya.tech), a Fround-end developer based in South Africa.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript...for now, i'm learning React These days.

I’ve got a bunch of projects, but my favorite is the [Anime-Blog](https://owamit9.github.io/Anime-Blog/).

#### Fun Facts:

* Hate coffee but love tea...i know it's weird
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
* **Hobbies:** anime, gym, coding
